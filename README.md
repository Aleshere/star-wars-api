# Star Wars API Project

# What I have learned building this

> API and template literals    
> Math.Random and Math.floor methods     
> Axios via CDN  
> Catch with dedicated function to display eventual errors  
> FAS spinner to fill the loading gaps  
> ## I already knew everything about this, it was more like a filler project to relax

## About

* I retrieved an old canvas I made a few weeks ago, that had a dynamic background recreating the stars warp movement from the OG Star Wars movies.
* I then added a very simple API structured app, which displays a few information after clicking of a "Find" btn. Used Math Random to randomize api calls
* Project status: working
